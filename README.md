### Inspiration
For the design on Sushi & Sake's website, I took inspiration from other Japanese restaurants. One of my favourite local restaurants, Kibou https://kibou.co.uk/ not only has delicious food but also a visually stunning website that helped me cultivate the feel of the Sushi & Sake website. I also browsed the Yo! Sushi website https://yosushi.com/ for menu ideas.
